# voilk-cli

Currently it supports only two methods :p but later as I work on it, more can be added

# How to install it?

It will be published soon to `npmjs`, but for now

1) clone the repo
2) cd into it
3) `npm install -g .`
4) it should install `voilk-cli@1.0.0` globally to your computer

# How to use it?

open your terminal


1) `voilk-cli -c get_account -i bilal`
2) `voilk-cli -c get_chain_id`


3) `voilk-cli --version`
4) `voilk-cli --help`
